** mapex **

This is a WIP extremely detailed map of the Brazilian Elections. This has the
potential for becoming a very interesting basis for political analyses as well
as a kickass visualization.

== INSTRUCTIONS ==

WIP.

== DATA ==

The data/ folder contains non-reproducible datasets that pertain to mapex.

* 2014-secoes.csv: This is a list of all "seções eleitorais" along with their
  addresses for the 2014 elections. This data (and data for all other recent
  election years) was provided to me via a LAI request to the TSE.

* Escolas.csv: This is a list of all schools in Brazil as of 2016 along with
  their addresses. This was obtained in
  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qgisbrasil/m3fCa5B1jDk. The geocoded
  information comes from a proprietary geocoding software. The original school
  data comes from someone else's LAI request to the Ministry of Education.

* stanford/all.csv: This contains an attempt to geocode all addresses in the
  seções database through a geocoder provided to me by Stanford University
  Libraries. It was generated with the help of
  https://github.com/cengel/ArcGIS_geocoding.
